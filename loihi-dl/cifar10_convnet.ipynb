    "from the dictionary, so that we don't have to specify it every time\n",
    "(e.g. we assume `on_chip = True`, unless we specify it otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nengo network has three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input neurons that are run off-chip to turn the input into spikes.\n",
    "   This is the first entry in `layer_confs`.\n",
    "   It is a 1x1 convolutional layer with 4 filters,\n",
    "   meaning that for each pixel (which has 3 color values),\n",
    "   it will apply a (learned) linear transform to turn those\n",
    "   3 values into 4 values,\n",
    "   and then pass that into `SpikingRectifiedLinear` neurons\n",
    "   to generate spikes.\n",
    "   The reason we don't just use the raw color channels is that\n",
    "   they can have both positive and negative values,\n",
    "   and we would have to figure out a way to transform them\n",
    "   to work with firing rates that can only have positive values.\n",
    "   One possible transform would be to use an on/off neuron pair\n",
    "   to represent each pixel,\n",
    "   resulting in 6 neurons per pixel.\n",
    "   Rather than force this specific encoding, though,\n",
    "   we find it easier to let the system learn the encoding via\n",
    "   the 1x1 convolutional layer.\n",
    "2. Convolutional and dense neural layers that are run on the chip (Loihi).\n",
    "   We specify these as in a normal convolutional neural network,\n",
    "   with any entry that begins with a `filters` parameter\n",
    "   describing a convolutional layer,\n",
    "   and any entry that begins with an `n_neurons` parameter\n",
    "   describing a dense layer.\n",
    "   One special parameter that we have is the `block` parameter.\n",
    "   This describes the size of representation that will\n",
    "   go on one \"block\" (i.e. Loihi core),\n",
    "   in `(rows, columns, channels)` format.\n",
    "   Loihi cores are limited to 1024 neurons,\n",
    "   so the product of the rows, columns, and channels must be `<= 1024`.\n",
    "   We also choose the block shape to minimize\n",
    "   the number of input and output axons to and from each core\n",
    "   (since these are also constrained on Loihi).\n",
    "   Multiple filters on a core can use the same axons,\n",
    "   so we try to increase the number of filters per core.\n",
    "   One approach is to have each layer represent\n",
    "   the entire spacial extent of the image,\n",
    "   but only a fraction of the filters.\n",
    "   For this network, we found that this approach was creating too many\n",
    "   output axons in earlier layers in the network,\n",
    "   so we decided to also split the image spacially.\n",
    "   For example, in the first layer on the chip\n",
    "   (the second entry in `layer_confs`),\n",
    "   the shape of the image being represented is `(15, 15, 64)`\n",
    "   (that is, 15 rows and columns, and 64 channels).\n",
    "   We make the block shape `(8, 8, 8)`,\n",
    "   which means that blocks will have to be tiled twice\n",
    "   both row-wise and column-wise to represent the spatial extent of the image.\n",
    "   However, the number of times we have to tile blocks\n",
    "   in the channel direction (to cover all 64 channels)\n",
    "   goes down, as compared with e.g. a block size of `(15, 15, 4)`,\n",
    "   and the number of axons is reduced.\n",
    "3. The final part of the network is the last layer, which collects the output.\n",
    "   Like the first layer, it runs off-chip,\n",
    "   and allows us to get data off the board.\n",
    "   We have intentionally made the layer right before it\n",
    "   (the last layer on the chip) only have 100 neurons,\n",
    "   so that we only have to record from 100 neurons to get data off the chip.\n",
