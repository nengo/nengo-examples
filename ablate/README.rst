Ablating neurons
****************

The Jupyter notebooks in this directory
emulate the ablation of neurons
by setting the encoders of those neurons to 0,
and setting the bias of those neurons to a large negative number.

The function of interest is::

    def ablate_ensemble(ens, proportion, sim, bias=True):
        """Ablate a proportion of the neurons in an ensemble.

        The ablation is done by setting the encoder and gain associated
        with a neuron to zero. Since no input current being injected,
        the neuron will generally be silent. However, if there is direct
        current injected with a neuron-to-neuron connection, then the
        cell may still fire. To counter that in most cases, we set the
        bias associated with the neuron to a large negative value.
        """

        n_neurons = min(int(ens.n_neurons * proportion), ens.n_neurons)
        idx = np.random.choice(np.arange(ens.n_neurons), replace=False, size=n_neurons)

        encoder_sig = sim.signals[sim.model.sig[ens]['encoders']]
        encoder_sig.setflags(write=True)
        encoder_sig[idx] = 0.0
        encoder_sig.setflags(write=False)

        if bias:
            bias_sig = sim.signals[sim.model.sig[ens.neurons]['bias']]
            bias_sig.setflags(write=True)
            bias_sig[idx] = -1000

The notebooks in this directory show how this can be applied
in a simple model (``ablate_ensemble.py``)
and a more complicated SPA model (``ablate_spa.py``).
