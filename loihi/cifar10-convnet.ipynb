    "  We pick it empirically to be\n",
    "  high enough to achieve the desired firing rates during training,\n",
    "  and low enough to not have a significant adverse effect on accuracy.\n",
    "- The `rate_target` is the target value used in the loss functions;\n",
    "  it includes the amplitude scaling, since the neuron outputs received\n",
    "  by the loss functions will also include the amplitude scaling.\n",
    "\n",

    "One is a standard `nengo.SpikingRectifiedLinear` neuron,\n",
    "which we use for our input neurons that are run off-chip.\n",
    "The other is a `LoihiLIF` neuron type, used for the on-chip neurons.\n",
    "This type takes into account the quantization error in Loihi neurons,\n",
    "so by training with this neuron type in NengoDL,\n",
    "our model is better able to deal with the quantization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the configuration,\n",
    "we define the configurable layer parameters in a list of dictionaries\n",
    "called `layer_confs`.\n",
    "When we create the network, we loop through these entries,\n",
    "and create one layer for each dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nengo network has three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input neurons that are run off-chip to turn the input into spikes.\n",
    "   This is the first entry in `layer_confs`.\n",
    "   It is a 1x1 convolutional layer with 4 filters,\n",
    "   meaning that for each pixel (which has 3 color values),\n",
    "   it will apply a (learned) linear transform to turn those\n",
    "   3 values into 4 values,\n",
    "   and then pass that into `SpikingRectifiedLinear` neurons\n",
    "   to generate spikes.\n",
    "   The reason we don't just use the raw color channels is that\n",
    "   they can have both positive and negative values,\n",
    "   and we would have to figure out a way to transform them\n",
    "   to work with firing rates that can only have positive values.\n",
    "   One possible transform would be to use an on/off neuron pair\n",
    "   to represent each pixel,\n",
    "   resulting in 6 neurons per pixel.\n",
    "   Rather than force this specific encoding, though,\n",
    "   we find it easier to let the system learn the encoding via\n",
    "   the 1x1 convolutional layer.\n",
    "   We could use a higher maximum firing rate for neurons in this layer\n",
    "   (up to `1 / dt`, where `dt` is the simulation timestep),\n",
    "   because these neurons are simulated off-chip and thus not subject\n",
    "   to the same quantization error as on-chip neurons.\n",
    "2. Convolutional and dense neural layers that are run on the chip (Loihi).\n",
    "   We specify these as in a normal convolutional neural network,\n",
    "   with any entry that begins with a `filters` parameter\n",
    "   describing a convolutional layer,\n",
    "   and any entry that begins with an `n_neurons` parameter\n",
    "   describing a dense layer.\n",
    "   One special parameter that we have is the `block` parameter.\n",
    "   This describes the size of representation that will\n",
    "   go on one \"block\" (i.e. Loihi core),\n",
    "   in `(rows, columns, channels)` format.\n",
    "   Loihi cores are limited to 1024 neurons,\n",
    "   so the product of the rows, columns, and channels must be `<= 1024`.\n",
    "   We also choose the block shape to minimize\n",
    "   the number of input and output axons to and from each core\n",
    "   (since these are also constrained on Loihi).\n",
    "   Multiple filters on a core can use the same axons,\n",
    "   so we try to increase the number of filters per core.\n",
    "   One approach is to have each layer represent\n",
    "   the entire spacial extent of the image,\n",
    "   but only a fraction of the filters.\n",
    "   For this network, we found that this approach was creating too many\n",
    "   output axons in earlier layers in the network,\n",
    "   so we decided to also split the image spatially.\n",
    "   For example, in the first layer on the chip\n",
    "   (the second entry in `layer_confs`),\n",
    "   the shape of the image being represented is `(15, 15, 64)`\n",
    "   (that is, 15 rows and columns, and 64 channels).\n",
    "   We make the block shape `(8, 8, 8)`,\n",
    "   which means that blocks will have to be tiled twice\n",
    "   both row-wise and column-wise to represent the spatial extent of the image.\n",
    "   However, the number of times we have to tile blocks\n",
    "   in the channel direction (to cover all 64 channels)\n",
    "   goes down, as compared with e.g. a block size of `(15, 15, 4)`,\n",
    "   and the number of axons is reduced. More information on configuring the\n",
    "   block size can be found\n",
    "   [here](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-loihi/tips.html#splitting-large-ensembles).\n",
    "3. The final part of the network is the last layer, which collects the output.\n",
    "   Like the first layer, it runs off-chip,\n",
    "   and allows us to get data off the board.\n",
    "   We have intentionally made the layer right before it\n",
    "   (the last layer on the chip) only have 100 neurons,\n",
    "   so that we only have to record from 100 neurons to get data off the chip.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we create each layer in the network,\n",
    "we print some information about the layer,\n",
    "which is shown as the output to this code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `learning_phase=True` configuration option to make sure that the\n",
